            Born Nicolas Kim Coppola on January 7, 1964, in Long Beach,
            California, Nicolas Cage was destined for greatness from the start.
            As a member of the renowned Coppola family, which includes legendary
            filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola as his uncle, Cage was exposed to the
            world of cinema from a young age. However, he sought to carve his
            own path in the industry, adopting the stage name "Nicolas Cage" to
            distinguish himself. Cage's early years were marked by determination
            and a thirst for acting, leading him to study theater at the
            American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco before making his
            mark on the big screen.
